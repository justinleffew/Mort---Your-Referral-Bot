- What was implemented
  - Parse explicit interest cues from contact notes and normalize/merge into radar_interests on note creation.
- Files changed
  - services/dataService.ts
  - prd.json
- Assumptions made (if any)
  - Interpreted explicit interest cues as phrases like "interests/hobbies/likes/enjoys/into/interested in" within notes and normalized them to lowercase keywords.
  - Treated the current HEAD as the base for the required branch because no main branch exists in this repo.
- Tests / checks run (and results)
  - npm run build (pass)
  - Skipped lint/typecheck/tests (no scripts in package.json).
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Patterns discovered
    - dataService.addNote is the centralized place to augment notes with derived contact metadata.
  - Gotchas
    - None observed.
